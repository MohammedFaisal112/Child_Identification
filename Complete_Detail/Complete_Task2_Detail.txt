Task 2
Detect weather they're child or not:

(Dataset is given in an code, Model weights was there as Age_Model.h5,Test images and Result images was also there with Basic Interface and in an Tested Folder tested model with accuracy score 0.825 with Different Interface was given.
More Training folder = Done more training with respect to an different dataset,the link was given in a code.Here classified it with children and adult and with the classification approach execute it.) 

Child detection is based on age parameter so it's a Regression problem.
Uploaded a data with a zipped File, unzipped it,then Mounted the drive.
Import Necessary Libraries.
Read a data in fldr.
In images saved an images in a form of array.Then from a data splited the age parameter stored it in ages list.Converting the List into an Array.
Then implementing Feature Scaling, Normailzation in an image(So the model will predict well and get good accuracy).
Graph Representation of Distribution of Age.
Images will be my Independent feature and Ages will be dependent feature.
Splitting a Independent and Dependent feature for Training and Testing Purpose.
Implement a CNN(Convolutional Neural Network).
In the output layer as well as in an hidden layer implemented a 'ReLu' activation function and Loss function/Cost function is my 'MAE'(Mean Absulate Error) with Adam optimizer and accuracy metrics.
Then Declare a Early Stopping (monitoring=value loss, patience of 25 epochs,total 250 epochs and batch_size is 64).then with a condition that if age is less than 20 then declare it as a child.

While Testing and Hyperparameter Tuning:
Does the same with the help of multi-classification techniques also by making group of ages but getting certain flaws.
Model Saved as Age_Model_Acc_0.825.h5.
And to Test this model Testing_Interface is given.

Having certain problems.The person face need to be visible more than 50% from an image and it need to be straight facing.
